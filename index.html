                        has a tendency to be forgetful and bossy, and she can be rude and stubborn if she doesn't know
                        any better, but she
                        will apologize if she realizes she has done something wrong. She has a temper at times, which
                        usually
                        only comes out if she fails at something or becomes irritated with George.

                        blueprints and even built a home for a family, he appears to be an engineer or architect.
